## What is TypeScript, and how is it different from JavaScript?

TypeScript is a programming language that extends the capabilities of JavaScript by introducing optional static typing and additional functionalities to the language. It was developed and is maintained by Microsoft.

A significant difference between TypeScript and JavaScript lies in the former's more robust type system. TypeScript enables the explicit declaration of variable, function, and other element types in code, with subsequent verification by the TypeScript compiler to ensure proper usage. Early detection of errors during the development process and enhancement of code predictability and maintainability can be facilitated by this approach.


## Can you explain the difference between "interface" and "type" in TypeScript?

TypeScript uses "interface" and "type" to specify object shapes and variable types. However, their uses differ.

TypeScript interfaces describe the properties and methods an object must have to be considered an instance of that interface. Extended interfaces can define function types.

A type is a means to rename a TypeScript type. Unions, intersections, and mapped types can be created using types.

So, In general we can say that interfaces specify object types, while types can define any type. Interfaces can be merged with others of the same name, and types can be aliased to give them new names.

## What is the difference between an "unknown" and "any" type in TypeScript?

A type that is unknown at compile time or can be any type at runtime can be represented in TypeScript with either the "unknown" or "any" keyword. There are, however, notable distinctions between the two.

The key distinction is that in TypeScript, "any" is the most permissive type and can have assignments of any type made to it without any type checking or errors being generated. While this is helpful in situations where you need the most freedom, it also increases the risk of missing type errors and makes the code less safe and manageable.

However, "unknown" is more restricted than "any" in terms of type. It's similar to "any" in that it can store any value, but unlike "any," you can't do anything with a "unknown" type before you check its type. Since the TypeScript compiler cannot determine the value of the "unknown" variable, it must employ more stringent type checking to guarantee type safety.

If the goal is to increase the safety and maintainability of your code and identify issues earlier in the development process, "unknown" is a better choice than "any." In situations where you require maximum freedom but still want to maintain type safety, the use of "unknown" rather than "any" is strongly encouraged.


## What is the "as" keyword used for in TypeScript?
Type assertion and casting are accomplished with the "as" keyword in TypeScript. One can use it to instruct the compiler to ignore its own assessment of a value's type and instead use your superior knowledge.


## Can you explain how to use "type guards" with "in" and "typeof" operators in TypeScript?

To restrict a variable's type in TypeScript based on its value at runtime, one can use type guards. They are particularly useful when working with union types, where a variable can have multiple possible types.

Type guards can be written in a number of different ways in TypeScript, although the "in" operator and the "typeof" operator are two of the most prevalent.

### Using the "in" operator
Using the "in" operator, we may determine whether or not a given property is present in an object. The presence or absence of a certain characteristic can be used to further specify the type of a variable.

### Using the "typeof" operator
The "typeof" operator allows one to check the type of a variable. One can use it to narrow down the type of a variable based on its type at runtime.
